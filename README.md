##Schedule
The meetings will take place on <del>Mondays</del> __Tuesdays__  at <del>14:15</del>__14:00__ in room <del>A302</del> __C109__ at the Sand.
The preliminary schedule looks as follows:
  * __13 Dec 2016__ :
  Organisation of the Reading Group, Backgrounds in Type theory, Introduction to Martin-Löf dependent type theory and its identity types. (David + Ingo)
  
  In the first meeting we discussed:

  1. The two kinds of judgments of Martin-Löf type theory.
  2. The FIEC-Schema for introducing new types (Formation, Introduction, Elimination, Computation Rules).
  3. Nondependent Product and Sum Types.
  4. Dependent Function Type (= Pi Type) and Dependent Product Type (= Sigma Type).
  5. The Type of natural numbers.
  6. The provability of the type-theoretic version of the Axiom of Choice.
  
  * __20 Dec 2016__ : We will discuss chapter 1 of the HoTT book, wrap up the remaining questions about the dependent function + product types and probably concentrate on the Identity-Type (propositional Identity) (Ingo)

  We discussed:

  1. The FIEC rules for the identity type.
  2. How the Elimination principle for the identity type does not allow us to deduce the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) property.
  3. How to strengthen the identity type with Streicher's axiom K so that UIP is deducible.
  4. The interpretation of the Identity Type as the Type of Paths in a topological space. (And the type of paths between these paths as the homotopies between the paths)
  5. Two examples of Higher Inductive Types: The circle S1 and the Type of Natural numbers mod 2.
